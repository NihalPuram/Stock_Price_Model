# Stock_Price_Models

## Using_Linear_and_Decision_Tree_Regression
Machine learning algorithm using sklearn's 'Decision Tree Regression' and 'Linear Regression'. Future Predictions are made using the more promising model. Exammple Data of Netflix is used.
To run the code on your machine, enter your required ticker and your tiingo api key.
This is model only supports the data available on tiingo, you can tweek the input parameters if you want to use other apis.
The end result is positive but quite not reliable. I would not suggest anyone to put real money in these predictions.
Iam not liable to anyone having any financial loss due to using my model.

## Using_Stacked_LSTM
Machine Learning algorithm for predicting the stock price using a stacked artificial recurring neural network called long short term memory (stacked LSTM). Example data of Coca-Cola is used.
To run the code on your machine, enter your required ticker and your tiingo api key.
This is model only supports the data available on tiingo, you can tweek the input parameters if you want to use other apis.
The end result is positive but quite not reliable. I would not suggest anyone to put real money in these predictions.
Iam not liable to anyone having any financial loss due to using my model.

## Using_Sentiment_Analysis
Machine Learning algorithm for analysing the stock direction using Sentimental analysis. Example data of the Dow jones industial average in used.
follow the instructions in the notebook to download the data from the kaggle website. You can upload it to the colab notebook in the marked call.
The end result is positive but quite not reliable. I would not suggest anyone to put real money in these predictions.
Iam not liable to anyone having any financial loss due to using my model.
