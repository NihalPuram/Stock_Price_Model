# Stock_Price_Model
Machine Learning algorithm for predicting the stock price using a stacked artificial recurring neural network called long short term memory (stacked LSTM).
To run the code on your machine, enter your required ticker and your tiingo api key.
This is model only supports the data available on tiingo, you can tweek the input parameters if you want to use other apis.
The end result is positive but quite not reliable. I would not suggest anyone to put real money in these predictions.
Iam not liable to anyone having any financial loss due to using my model.
